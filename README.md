# 🎓 Student Performance Indicator

An End-to-End Machine Learning Project that predicts student mathematics performance based on demographic, educational, and socio-economic factors.

The project covers the complete Machine Learning lifecycle including data ingestion, data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, and a user-friendly web application built using Streamlit.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Educational institutions generate large amounts of student data. Analyzing this data can help identify factors that influence academic performance.

This project predicts a student's **Math Score** using various attributes such as:

* Gender
* Race/Ethnicity
* Parental Level of Education
* Lunch Type
* Test Preparation Course
* Reading Score
* Writing Score

The application allows users to enter student information through a web interface and instantly receive a predicted math score.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to understand how different factors affect student academic performance and build a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting student math scores.
